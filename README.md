Research on Convolutional Neural Networks

This is works by detecting the patterns , for instance, you want to change the hairstyle, cnn works by detecting the patterns that is the hair is on the head. then we can swap it with hairstyles you choose, there are many frameworks but i recommended tensorflow, its developed by google.

here is the github link if you are interested in dev

tensorflow/tensorflow

Lenses detect key facial points to show where the borders of the lips, eyes, nose, and face are. Then, ML engine builds a mask matching the face correctly even if youâ€™re moving (for example, using openCV or any graphic library).
